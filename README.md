ðŸš¦ Proud to share a team project I've been working on: an AI-based Traffic Management System designed to optimize traffic flow at major junctions using real-time data! Our team is utilizing computer vision with YOLO object detection to dynamically control traffic signals based on live traffic conditions. Key features include:

Dynamic signal control: Prioritizing the road with the heaviest traffic and adjusting green signal timings up to 3 minutes.
Real-time adaptability: Continuously monitors and adjusts priorities if traffic changes on other roads.
Smart optimization: Improves traffic flow, especially on busy routes with traffic from multiple directions.
Grateful to collaborate with such a talented team in implementing innovative AI solutions for smarter cities!
